    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
    # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

    # GitHub/GitLab repository to push the formula to
    tap:
      owner: hinyinlam
      name: homebrew-tap

      # Optionally a branch can be provided.

      token: "{{ .Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

    # Allows you to set a custom download strategy. Note that you'll need
    # to implement the strategy and add it to your tap repository.

    # Default is empty.

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.

    # So you can `brew test` your formula.
    # Default is empty.

    # Custom install script for brew.
    # Default is 'bin.install "program"'.
